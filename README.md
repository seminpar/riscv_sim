RISC-V ISA Simulator

For this project, you are to write an instruction set architecture (ISA) level simulator for RISC-V

You are only responsible for implementing the RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set as described in
Chapter 2 of the RISC-V ISA Instruction Set Manual, Volume I (https://riscv.org/wp-
content/uploads/2019/12/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf). You can ignore the memory ordering
instructions, the environment call and breakpoints, and hint instructions (Sections 2.7 â€“ 2.9).
